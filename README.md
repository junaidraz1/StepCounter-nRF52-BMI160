# StepCounter-nRF52-BMI160
This repository showcases the implementation of a step counter using the BMI160 motion sensor and an nRF52 Development Kit. The project leverages the I2C interface to communicate with the BMI160 sensor and uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to send real-time step count data to the nRF Connect app.
